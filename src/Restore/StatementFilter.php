/**
 * Decides which mysqldump statements must be skipped during a programmatic
 * restore.
 *
 * mysqldump emits several statements that are useless — or actively harmful —
 * when a dump is replayed piecemeal (per table) through a single PDO
 * connection inside a managed transaction. This pure, stateless class keeps
 * that policy in one trivially unit-testable place.
 *
 * Skipped statement families:
 *
 *   LOCK TABLES / UNLOCK TABLES
 *     mysqldump wraps every table block in LOCK/UNLOCK. Executing these
 *     during a programmatic restore implicitly commits the active
 *     transaction (breaking atomicity) and locks the PDO connection so no
 *     table outside the lock list — including the restore's own tracking
 *     table — can be reached until UNLOCK TABLES runs, which may never
 *     happen if the restore fails mid-table. The restore already runs
 *     inside a transaction with FK checks disabled, so the locks are
 *     unnecessary.
 *
 *   Session save/restore statements referencing @OLD_* user variables
 *     mysqldump snapshots the current session state at the start of the
 *     dump (e.g. SET @OLD_TIME_ZONE=@@TIME_ZONE, wrapped in a versioned
 *     comment) and replays it at the end (e.g. SET TIME_ZONE=@OLD_TIME_ZONE,
 *     likewise wrapped). SqlDumpParser splits the dump per table, so the
 *     "save" statement (in the dump header) never reaches a table buffer,
 *     while the matching "restore" footer lands in the last captured
 *     table's buffer. There @OLD_TIME_ZONE is NULL and MySQL rejects
 *     SET TIME_ZONE=@OLD_TIME_ZONE with error 1231 ("Variable 'time_zone'
 *     can't be set to the value of 'NULL'"). The same NULL problem affects
 *     every @OLD_* pair (SQL_MODE, FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS, UNIQUE_CHECKS,
 *     SQL_NOTES, CHARACTER_SET_*, COLLATION_CONNECTION). The restore
 *     manages its own session state (FK checks + transaction), so this
 *     bookkeeping is both useless and dangerous here.
